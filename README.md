# Unit-1
HTML, CSS, and Git Homework
This project was built to showcase my new skills as a web developer. The project is an "about me" page in which a short bio about myself can be found, along with a contact information page as well as a porfolio page. I learned a vast amount of new information while working on this project including how to use such things as: floats, z-index, and containers. With new information comes a lot of frustration as well and this project was a difficult undertaking for me.
