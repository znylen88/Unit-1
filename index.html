        <img src="assets/images/IMG_1105.JPG" height="150" width="170">Transplant to San Diego via Portland, Oregon and
        loving my life down here thus far. I studied Anthropology and International Studies at Portland State
        University before making the move to San Diego in 2015. I spent the last year or so going the nursing school
        route
        at Mesa College before deciding that this path wasnâ€™t really for me. After much debate and consideration, I
        decided
        to completely change paths and switch into unknown territory, web development. I look forward to gaining
        the skills and knowledge needed to be successful in this new career. In my free time, I enjoy beach days
        and hiking. I try to go on a hike at least once a week. I'm a true Oregonian and nature has always be very near
        and
        dear to my heart. In addition, I love world travel and have spent much time in South America over the years.
        I'm planning a big trip to The Philippines early next year and am super excited to explore a little slice of
        Southeast Asia.</p>
