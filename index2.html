                Oregon and
                loving my life down here thus far. I studied Anthropology and International Studies at Portland State
                University before making the move to San Diego in 2015. I spent the last year or so going the nursing
                school
                route
                at Mesa College before deciding that this path was not really for me. After much debate and
                consideration, I
                decided
                to completely change paths and switch into unknown territory, web development. I look forward to gaining
                the skills and knowledge needed to be successful in this new career. In my free time, I enjoy beach days
                and hiking. I try to go on a hike at least once a week. I'm a true Oregonian and nature has always be
                very near
                and
                dear to my heart. In addition, I love world travel and have spent much time in South America over the
                years.
                I'm planning a big trip to The Philippines early next year and am super excited to explore a little
                slice of
                Southeast Asia.</p>
